### Culture & Development process
* We are team of passionated software developers and we have our own git management guideline, please check [backend repository](https://github.com/jobhubgroup/job-hub-api) for further more detail.
* We have a CI/CD integration with [Circle CI](https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/github/Jobhubgroup) connected with our Github account
* Pushing to Git branch `prod` will deploy content to the production server
* Pushing to Git branch `master` will deploy content to the staging server
* You are supposed to merge all your work to `dev` branch and `master` is the next, `prod` should be the final step
* You can check our circle ci config from [here](./.circleci/config.yml)

### Technical guideline
* We use [Angular](https://angular.io), [bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com) for UI framework and decorating widgets
* Our project is using [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io), you can follow guide from their offical website
* We use [Heroku](https://heroku.com) for staging server, hosts using [Node express server](./server.js)
* For the production server everthing is configured via **S3 + Cloudfront + Route53**, please check aws console for further more detail
